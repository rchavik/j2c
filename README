j2c: Joomla to Croogo Migration Tool
------------------------------------

j2c is a overly simplistic croogo/cakephp plugin to help migrate 
contents from Joomla to Croogo.

This plugin is still being developed and currently being tested with 
Joomla 1.5 and Croogo 'next' branch.

Currently it supports migration of:
	Users
	Sections and Categories (mapped as Categories in Croogo)
	Contents

Usage:

- clone or copy the j2c repository into your croogo's plugin directory
- add a new database configuration entry in your croogo's config/database.php
  named $joomla with the appropriate credentials.
- execute

	cake j2c migrate
